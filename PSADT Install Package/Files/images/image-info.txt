The image script (New-LSInfoImage.ps1) will randomly select an image (.jpg) from this folder that matches the aspect ratio of the primary display where the script is running. 

Currently, we include the same image but in different formats: 2.4:1 for our wide screens, 3:2 for our Surface devices, 16:9 for our standard desktop monitors, and 21:9 for our other wide screens. In the past, we included a lot of images from around our campus. If you go this route, there is a chance a different image could be picked whenever the script runs (as long as it matches the display's aspect ratio). It adds *variety*!...
